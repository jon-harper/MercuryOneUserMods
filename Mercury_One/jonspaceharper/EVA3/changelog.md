# EVA 3 for Mercury One.1

## Changelog

## 23/01/24

- `front_universal_pis_fi.stl`: Added FYSETC PIS (portable input shaper) support
- `pcb36_mount.stl`, `pcb42_mount.stl`: Added two files for, e.g., EBB36 and EBB42 stepper-mounted PCBS.
- These should support *all* stepper mounted PCBs, not just CANBUS (e.g., BTT Piggyback36).
- `pcb_shroud.stl`, `pcb_shroud_cat.stl` two shrouds to cover up the PCB wiring added (one is whimsical).

## 23/01/23

- Alternate top piece removes the cable support mount entirely now.
- Started work on rear PCB mount with integrated cable support instead.

## 23/01/20

## 23/01/19

- Fixed missing screw holes in the alternate top piece.
- Shortened the front intake duct by 1mm.

## 23/01/18

- `5015_sidways_inlet_fi.stl`: Added some walls for the 5015 fan to sit in and a notch for the bit around the exhaust.
- Added a Z limit switch mount to raise the limit switch height. Comes with a cover.
- Added a front intake duct that lets you remove the fan with two screws instead of four.
- Note: the intake duct is not compatible with 4020 fans (or you lose Y space).
