# Mercury One.1 Belt Path CAD

This `STEP` file contains the motion system and frame for Mercury One.1.

I created it to ensure the EVA 3 mod would fit; it may be useful for other toolhead mods.

## Notes

- This mod *does not* contain printable parts from M1.1.
- The frame is slightly modified with extra brackets. No other variations from a bare Ender 5 frame exist.
