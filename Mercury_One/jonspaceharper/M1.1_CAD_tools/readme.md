## Mercury_One_Tolerances.f3d

This is a parametric template file for M1 part tolerances. It saves entering them yourself or remembering them.

1. Insert derive into a Fusion file.
2. Check the parameters button, click okay. (The file is otherwise empty)
3. Back in your Fusion file, open the Parameters dialog.
4. Go down to the bottom where the parameters for Mercury One Tolerances are listed.
5. Star the ones you need for your file.
6. You can now use the parameters as variables in your Fusion file.

## Mercury One.1 Belt Path.step

This `STEP` file contains the motion system and frame for Mercury One.1.

I created it to ensure the EVA 3 mod would fit; it may be useful for other toolhead mods.

### Notes

- This *does not* contain printable parts from M1.1.
- The frame is slightly modified with extra brackets. No other variations from a bare Ender 5 frame exist.
